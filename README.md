### BootstrapX = Bootstrap Examples

I created BootstrapX as a project to experiment with the Bootstrap framework. I tested many components and tried to make them as useful as possible. I also added real words (not Lorem Ipsum - Simpsons, Star Wars quotes, and more!) and working links in order to get the full experience of how it would really feel like to implement them on your website. Soon, I plan to add components from the [Froala Design Blocks](https://www.froala.com/design-blocks) and other frameworks such as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

If you'd like, you can gladly help out on the Github repository by making a pull request or request a specific component by opening an issue. 

So far,
I'm using the official Bootstrap [components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/),
[fillerama.io](http://fillerama.io/) for some text,
and the [Hydejack](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack) Jekyll theme by @qwtel.

See the website for components, code, and pictures: http://maxshalom.me/BootstrapX/

To see live, working component examples: http://bootstrapx.surge.sh/

Also, if you'd like you can see the full HTML files and assets used in the [Components](https://github.com/MaxShalom/BootstrapX/tree/master/Components)
folder. All the code snippets used in the website can be found in the [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/MaxShalom/e57726dff969dab9eb866f5f179f9518).
